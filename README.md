## Introduction
 This Power BI dashboard was developed to support **job seekers, career switchers, and professionals** exploring new roles in the data field. It addresses a common challenge: information about the data job market is often fragmented and difficult to interpret.

By leveraging a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings—including job titles, salary information, and locations—this project brings everything into one clear and interactive view. The dashboard allows users to easily explore market trends, compare compensation, and gain practical insights into the current data job landscape.

**Data Transformation (ETL) with Powe## Skills Showcased
r Query**

Raw data was cleaned, reshaped, and prepared for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing data types, and creating additional calculated columns.

  **Measures & KPIs**

Custom measures were created to calculate key performance indicators such as `median Yearly annual` salary and `job count`, enabling meaningful comparisons across roles and locations.

**Core Visualizations**

Common Power BI visuals—including column charts, bar charts, line charts, and area charts—were used to analyze job demand and observe trends over time.

  **Geographic Analysis**



Map visuals were applied to display the global distribution of data-related jobs, highlighting regional patterns and market concentration.

  **KPI Cards & Tables**

Cards were used to present high-level metrics at a glance, while tables provided detailed, sortable views for deeper exploration of the data.

**Dashboard Layout & Design**

The dashboard was designed with a clean and intuitive layout, using appropriate visual choices and spacing to clearly communicate insights and support effective storytelling.

**Interactive Reporting**

Slicers were implemented to dynamically filter results by job title and other dimensions.
Buttons and bookmarks were used to improve navigation and create a smooth user experience.

**Drill-Through**

Drill-through functionality enables users to move from high-level summaries to more detailed views.
